Build towers with money, and reinforce them as you gain more money with the bounty you get from catching the virus that isattempting to infiltrate your motherboard.\r\n(Written by Jonathan Fische)\r\n## Instructions\r\nTo play, simply download the ZIP file and open \"Y3kDefend.exe\" (Windows) or \"Y3kDefend.app\" (Mac).\r\n## Team Members\r\n* Kei Hitomi\r\n* Steven Wendling\r\n* Matt Roseman\r\n* Hun Jae Lee\r\n* Robert Noetzel\r\n* Jonathan Fische\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
